# Snake-Water-Gun
🎮 Inspired by the classic Stone-Paper-Scissors game, this project reimagines the concept with an Indian twist — Snake-Water-Gun! Built using Python and Tkinter, it features an interactive GUI, sound effects, real-time scoring, and engaging visuals to make each round both fun and intuitive. 🐍💧🔫
