# 🐍💧🔫 Snake Water Gun – The Ultimate Showdown!

Welcome to the ancient, legendary, and mildly dramatic battle between **Snake**, **Water**, and **Gun**!  
Built with Python, Tkinter, and a dash of sound effects to keep your fingers clicking and your brain guessing.

---

## 🎮 Game Overview

Just like Stone beats Scissors and all that jazz, here are the rules:

- 🐍 Snake drinks Water → Snake wins  
- 💧 Water disables Gun → Water wins  
- 🔫 Gun shoots Snake → Gun wins  
- Same choice? It’s a tie!

You'll face off against the computer in **5 intense rounds**, and at the end, you'll know if you’re a true champion or just having a bad click day.
